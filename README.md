# App-Founder
[Live demo](https://app-founder.herokuapp.com)
Server and client are hosted on heroku. After some time, the application is put to sleep by Heroku due to inactivity. I try to ping the client but it may happen that you will have to wait a moment to load.

This project was created to learn developing SPA with MEAN software bundle. 
The full tech-stack:
* Angular5
* AngularMaterial+flexbox
* Node.js/Express
* MongoDB/MLab

App is not finished and has a lot bugs, layout is also not optimized for small screens.
Main concept assumed functionality like:
* Register/login user
* Creating teams and projects by user
* Invitation system where user can be in multiple teams
* Team leader can make offer to the project owner. Project owner chooses from offers.

I  must admit that this app deviates from main angular guide.   
In plan:
* crate core folder
* make separation of services and move some of them to every component folder
* move most of component logic to services
* start to using typescript features(interfaces, classes)
