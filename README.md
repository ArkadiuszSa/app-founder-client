# App-Founder
This project was created to learn developing SPA with MEAN software bundle.
The full tech-stack:
* Angular5
* AngularMaterial+flexbox
* Node.js/Express
* MongoDB/MLab

Server and client are hosted on heroku.
App is not finished and layout is not optimized for small screens.
Main concept assumed functionality like:
* Register/login user
* Creating teams and projects by user
* Invitation system where user can be in multiple teams
* Team leader can make offer to the project owner. Project owner chooses from offers.


On this time app is not finished. I must admit that this app deviates from main angular guide.
